          <p>I am a web development student at Seattle Central college with a prospective graduation date of Summer, 2022.
            I'm especially interested in responsive web design, accessibility, and, of course, designing beautiful websites.
          <br>COvid jumpstarted my transition out of the restaurant industry and I'm excited to try something new.
          My goal is to eventually support myself primarily via freelance work. I also want to hone the technical skills 
              nescessary to donate my time and efforts to causes which are important to me.
           <br>Outside of school, I enjoy running, traveling, watching documentaries, listening to podcasts, and spending
              time with my cat, Moose.</p>
