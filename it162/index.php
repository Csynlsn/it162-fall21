          <p>I am a web development student at Seattle Central college with a prospective graduation date of Summer, 2022.
            I'm especially interested in responsive web design, accessibility, and, of course, designing beautiful websites.
          COvid jumpstarted my transition out of the restaurant industry and I'm excited to try something new.</p>
          <p>My goal is to eventually support myself primarily via freelance work. I also want to hone the technical skills 
              nescessary to donate my time and efforts to causes which are important to me.</p>
          <p id="bottom">Outside of school, I enjoy running, traveling, watching documentaries, listening to podcasts, and spending
              time with my cat, Moose.</p>
